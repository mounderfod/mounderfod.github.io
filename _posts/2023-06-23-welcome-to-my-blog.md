Hello, I have decided to set up a blog on my website :)
Basically, I will use this page to create more long-form posts to express various ideas and other things that I've found cool recently.

### How does the website work?
The frontend was all written by me in raw HTML/CSS. The little time marquee at the top of the page was my own idea, but I... *borrowed* the time formatting code from Stack Overflow.

In terms of backend, the website uses [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) and is being hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/mounderfod/website) using Vercel to deploy it.

If anything is not working or you just want to contact me, see the [About page](/about).
