This post is being written in [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) :)

### What?

Emacs is, according to its own website:

> "An extensible, customizable, free/libre text editor â€” and more."

Basically, it's one of the oldest text editors to exist, is (technically) entirely keyboard-based, and manages to combine simplicity with power. In short, it's great and I'm going to talk about it now.

### Why?

Why am I using Emacs? Well, there's a few reasons:

- I'd heard of it before and it sounded cool
- It's complex enough that it would present an interesting learning curve, but not so difficult as to discourage me
- It's useful for editing posts and HTML like this
- It ships with Tetris built in (need I say more?)

### How?

I went to the website and downloaded it.
My laptop currently uses Windows, and Emacs is made by GNU so as expected I was berated for my choice of OS:

> "To improve the use of proprietary systems is a misguided goal. Our aim, rather, is to eliminate them."

But I wasn't going to concern myself with GNU's plans for world domination; that's a problem for another day. The install was fairly simple, like any other application, and upon running the program I am greeted with a pleasant menu screen:

Now it was time for me to learn how to use Emacs.
Emacs is primarily keyboard-based, as it was developed at a time where not all computers had GUIs at all, let alone mice to interact with them. As such, and also due to its age, it has its own set of keybinding patterns which are overall very different to that of most applications. For example, saving a file in MS Word is `Ctrl-S`, while in Emacs it is `C-x C-s`, which basically means `Ctrl-x` followed by `Ctrl-S`. You'll notice that in this example, two keybindings need to be pressed to perform one action. This is very common in Emacs, as there are lots of commands and not many keys, and there are even some commands that don't have keybindings and must be invoked by pressing `M-x` (`M` meaning `Alt`) and then typing the command name out.

This was all a bit complex for me to understand at first, but I quickly got the hang of it (as I had done with the more standard keybinding patterns that existed elsewhere in the computing world).
