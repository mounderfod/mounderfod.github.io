# musi supa pona

**musi supa pona** *(toki pona for "simple table game")* is a simplistic tabletop role playing game
(TTRPG) inspired by 5th edition Dungeons & Dragons. The game aims to abstract much of the
features of a TTRPG in order to give more power to the game master and their storytelling as opposed
to complex game mechanics as seen in other entertaining, but difficult to pick up, tabletop games. The
side effect of the game's simplicity is that game masters have a lot more work to do in creating content
for their players - **this is intentional**, and if that doesn't sound like your thing then musi supa pona
is not the game for you.
